Leaks in water distribution networks (WDNs) produce significant economic losses. These leaks from underground pipelines affect the surrounding environment in different ways that can be detected
using various technologies. This article introduces an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) equipped with an infrared temperature sensor to remotely detect thermal anomalies on the surface caused by underground
leaking pipelines. An MLX90614 low-cost thermopile infrared sensor was proposed to trace the surface temperature above leaking pipelines and record the corresponding position of each reading.
