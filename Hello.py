    Leaks in water distribution networks (WDNs) produce significant economic losses. These leaks
from underground pipelines affect the surrounding environment in different ways that can be detected
using various technologies. This project introduces an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) equipped with
an infrared temperature sensor to remotely detect thermal anomalies on the surface caused by
underground leaking pipelines. An MLX90614 low-cost thermopile infrared sensor was proposed to
trace the surface temperature above leaking pipelines and record the corresponding position of each
reading. A satellite navigation system used to acquire precise location.
